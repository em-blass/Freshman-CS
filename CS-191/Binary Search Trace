    Question #1 What positions would be examined in a binary search for 14? What value would be returned by the binarySearch function?
    - Answer: 4 1 2 | 2 {(0 + 9 / 2 = 4 (0 + 4) / 2 = 2 - 1 (1 + 2) / 2 = 1}

    Question #2 What positions would be examined in a binary search for 91? What value would be returned by the binarySearch function?
    - Answer: 4 7 8 | 8  {(0 + 9) / 2 = 4 (4 + 9) / 2 = 6 + 1 (7 + 9) / 2 = 8}

    Question #3 What positions would be examined in a binary search for -18? What value would be returned by the binarySearch function?
    - Answer: 4 2 1 | 1 {(0 + 9) / 2 = 4 (0 + 4) / 2 = 2 (0 + 2) / 2 = 1}

    Question #4 What positions would be examined in a binary search for 33? What value would be returned by the binarySearch function?
